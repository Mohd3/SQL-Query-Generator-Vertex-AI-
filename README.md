ðŸ“Š AI-Powered SQL Query Generation App

This project is a Streamlit app that allows users to ask questions in natural language. The app uses Google Vertex AI Gemini to generate SQL queries, runs them on your MySQL database, and returns both the SQL query and the AI-generated answer.

The demo uses the AtliQ Tees database, a sample dataset for a clothing store that tracks inventory, sales, and discounts.
